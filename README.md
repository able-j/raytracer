# Raytracer (Work in Progress)

This project is a simple raytracer written in C++, inspired by the book *The Ray Tracer Challenge*.  
It aims to implement fundamental raytracing techniques such as sphere intersections, lighting, shading, and basic scene construction.

## Features
- Basic ray-object intersection
- Simple sphere rendering
- Basic point lighting model
- Scene building foundations

## Status
Work in Progress â€” core structures implemented, lighting and complex objects still under development.

## Planned Improvements
- Camera system for dynamic scene rendering
- Reflection and refraction models
- Advanced material properties (metallic, glass surfaces)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build using CMake:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
